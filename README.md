# SimpleFileSystem

This project was done as part of the McGill Operating Systems course (ECSE427). It consists of a C program that simulates a Simple File System that can be mounted by the user under a directory in the user's machine. This design introduces many limitations, such as restricted filename lengths, no user concept, no protection among files, no support for concurrent access, and others. 

# Features 

The SimpleFileSystem allows the user to create and delete files, as well as read and write to/from them.
